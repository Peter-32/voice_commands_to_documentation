# README

### Describe the idea informally as if describing it to a friend

Listen to my answers about documentation

### Explain which actionable metric you expect to improve from this idea

We have any actual metrics

### List any assumptions that have led you to find this idea as a priority idea

I assume it's step 3 of every project to create documentation so I thought it might be worthwhile to work on

### List any assumptions that will help you solve the problem quicker

On this case I actually I think it's a very similar problem to the last project salt just use most of that code

### Has something similar been worked on, and what was the result

Yes the list of ideas project and the result was that it worked pretty well at putting the text into excel files

### Why do we think this idea solves a user problem

I just thought it would be easier just press a button rather than open up documentation copy paste in

### What are the benefits of this idea

It's probably kind of cool and it will probably lead to more usage of documentation creation

### How will this feature be used by the user

They have to download the get projects and then create a shell script that is a shortcut to run this in the background and then would populate an excel spreadsheet to put on mark down into your copy paste so you can use that and probably save that on your desktop as well

### What is a workaround to solving this problem without building the feature

A template and then filling the text underneath which would work is pretty well as well

### What relevant data is in the data warehouse already

Dunedin

### What relevant data do you want to place into the data warehouse

Nothing

### Would this data come from either tracking servers, APIs, web scraping, or sensor data

None of nothing

### What data should not be used

I know data involved

### What data system would best store each new dataset

Data involved

### What data should be encrypted to reduce the risk of hackers or being sued

None

### In what way will the data still be messy and need to be cleaned up

As he read through it you'll probably see a lot of miss transcriptions that needs to be retyped or just left as-is

### Steps that will be taken to ensure the accuracy of the data involved

I know steps taken the user just has to reread it and fix any mistakes

### The status of the idea and the result

In progress

### Information to help with the maintenance of the feature

Develop in the jupyter notebook and the script itself should be converting it to a python script and description also be running the python script

### Information to help sales/marketing promote the feature

A hands-free way of creating technical documentation

### Information to help support or users troubleshoot frequently asked questions

You can use any documentation questions you just have to swap it out and if you run into any problems just email me and I'll look into it

### Meeting summaries and action items

None as of today
